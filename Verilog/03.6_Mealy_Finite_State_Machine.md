# ⚙️ Mealy Finite State Machine

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

Design a **Mealy FSM** that meets the following requirements:

- One input: `w`
- One output: `z`
- Output `z = 1` only if the **last two inputs were both 1**
- Transitions and output evaluations occur on the **positive edge of the clock**
- Implemented using a **Mealy-style FSM** where the output depends on the **state and input**

---

## 🤔 Why Use a Mealy FSM?

In a **Mealy FSM**, the output is generated based on:

- The **current state**
- The **current input**

### Benefits:

- Requires **fewer states** than Moore FSMs
- **Faster response** to input changes (output can change within the same clock cycle)
- **More compact** design in many applications

## 🔁 FSM Design Strategy

### 🎯 Goal:

Detect when **two consecutive inputs `w` are 1**. That means: `z = 1` at the **second 1 in a row**.

### 📊 State Description

| State | Meaning         | Output `z` (if `w = 1`) |
| ----- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| A     | Initial / w = 0 | 0                       |
| B     | One 1 seen      | 1                       |

## ⭕ State Diagram

```
        +---------+    w=1,z=0     +---------+
         |    A    | -------------> |    B    |
         |  z=0    |                | z=1 if w=1
         +---------+                +---------+
             ^   |                      |
             |   | w=0,z=0              | w=0,z=0
             +---+----------------------+
```

- **A → B**: When `w = 1` (first 1 detected), go to state B, output is still `z = 0`
- **B → B**: If another `w = 1` arrives, stay in B, output `z = 1`
- **Any `w = 0`**: Return to A, and output is `z = 0`

## 💻 Verilog Implementation Breakdown

```verilog
module Mealy11(clk, reset, w, z, y, Y);
    input clk, reset, w;
    output z;
    output reg y, Y;

    parameter A = 0, B = 1;

    always @(posedge clk, negedge reset) begin
        if (reset == 0)
            y = A;  // Reset to initial state
        else begin
            y = Y;  // Update current state to next
            casex(y)
                A: if (w == 1) Y = B; else Y = A;
                B: if (w == 1) Y = B; else Y = A;
            endcase
        end
    end

    assign z = ((y == B) & (w == 1));
endmodule
```

### 🔢 State Encoding

```verilog
parameter A = 0, B = 1;
```

- A: Starting state
- B: After detecting one `1`

---

## 🧾 Output Logic (Mealy Style)

```verilog
assign z = ((y == B) & (w == 1));
```

**Output `z = 1`** only when:

- **Current state is B**
- AND input **`w = 1`**

This confirms that we’ve seen **two consecutive `1`s**.

## 🧪 Example Input/Output Behavior

| Clock Cycle | `w` | State | Output `z` |
| ----------- | --- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1           | 1   | A → B | 0          |
| 2           | 1   | B     | 1 ✅       |
| 3           | 0   | A     | 0          |
| 4           | 1   | A → B | 0          |
| 5           | 1   | B     | 1 ✅       |
