# 🔁 Finite State Machines with Mealy and Moore

---

## 📘 Introduction to FSMs

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a type of **sequential circuit**.  
Unlike combinational circuits, FSM outputs depend not only on **current inputs** but also on **previous inputs** stored in memory (states).

FSMs operate under a clock and consist of:

- **Flip-flops** to store states
- **Combinational logic** to determine next states and outputs

### Types of FSMs

| Type  | Output Depends On       | Characteristics                      |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Moore | Current state only      | More stable, may require more states |
| Mealy | Current state and input | Faster response, fewer states        |

## ⚙️ Mealy FSM Design

### 🧪 Problem Statement

Design an FSM that sets output `z = 1` only if the last **two consecutive inputs `w` were 1**.  
All transitions occur on the **positive edge of the clock**.

| Present State | Input `w` | Next State | Output `z` |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| A             | 0         | A          | 0          |
| A             | 1         | B          | 0          |
| B             | 0         | A          | 0          |
| B             | 1         | B          | 1          |

### 💻 Verilog Code (Mealy FSM)

```verilog
module Mealy11(clk, reset, w, z, y, Y);
    input clk, reset, w;
    output z;
    output reg y, Y;

    parameter A = 0, B = 1;

    always @(posedge clk, negedge reset)
    begin
        if (reset == 0)
            y = A;
        else begin
            y = Y;
            casex(y)
                A: if (w == 1) Y = B;
                   else Y = A;
                B: if (w == 1) Y = B;
                   else Y = A;
            endcase
        end
    end

    assign z = ((y == B) & (w == 1));
endmodule
```

### ✅ Explanation

- **States**: A (initial), B (after one `w=1`)
- **Transitions**: Move to B on `w=1`, return to A on `w=0`
- **Output**: `z=1` only when in state B **and** `w=1`
- **Fast response** due to Mealy logic

## ⚙️ Moore FSM Design

### 🧪 Problem Statement

Design an FSM where output `z = 1` only if the **last two inputs were both 1**.  
Unlike Mealy, here the output depends **only on the current state**.

### 📊 State Table (From Lab PDF)

| Present State | Input `w` | Next State | Output `z` |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| A             | 0         | A          | 0          |
| A             | 1         | B          | 0          |
| B             | 0         | A          | 0          |
| B             | 1         | C          | 0          |
| C             | 0         | A          | 1          |
| C             | 1         | C          | 1          |

### 💻 Verilog Code (Moore FSM)

```verilog
module moore11(clk, reset, w, z);
    input clk, reset, w;
    output reg z;
    reg [1:0] state, next_state;

    parameter A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10;

    // State transition
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            state <= A;
        else
            state <= next_state;
    end

    // Next state logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A: next_state = (w) ? B : A;
            B: next_state = (w) ? C : A;
            C: next_state = (w) ? C : A;
            default: next_state = A;
        endcase
    end

    // Output logic
    always @(*) begin
        case (state)
            A, B: z = 0;
            C:    z = 1;
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

### ✅ Explanation

- **States**: A (initial), B (after one `w=1`), C (after two `w=1`s)
- **Output**: `z=1` only in **state C**, independent of `w`
- **More stable** output than Mealy but **slightly slower response**

## ⚖️ Comparison of Mealy vs Moore FSMs

| Feature        | Moore FSM        | Mealy FSM (Your Code)   |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Output depends | State only       | State + Input           |
| States used    | More             | Fewer                   |
| Response       | Delayed by clock | Faster (Immediate)      |
| Stability      | More stable      | Can glitch if not timed |

## 🔧 Extendability

You can extend both FSM templates to detect **longer input patterns** like `"1001"` by:

- Adding more states
- Modifying `casex` or `case` logic
- Adjusting output logic appropriately
