# üéõÔ∏è Moore Finite State Machine

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

We need to design a **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)** that satisfies the following:

- One input: `w`
- One output: `z`
- Output `z = 1` if the last **two consecutive inputs were both 1**
- All transitions happen on the **positive edge of the clock**
- If the pattern is not satisfied, `z` remains 0

---

## üß† Why a Moore FSM?

In a **Moore FSM**, the output depends **only on the current state**, not directly on inputs. This means:

- The output becomes valid **after a full clock cycle**
- May require **more states** than Mealy FSMs
- Provides **more stable outputs**

## üîÑ State Transition Process

To detect two consecutive 1s, we define three states:

### üìä States

| State | Meaning                         | Output `z` |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| A     | Initial state or last `w` was 0 | 0          |
| B     | Last `w` was 1                  | 0          |
| C     | Two consecutive 1s seen         | 1          |

```
       +---------+     w=1     +---------+     w=1     +---------+
        |    A    | ----------> |    B    | ----------> |    C    |
        |  z = 0  |             |  z = 0  |             |  z = 1  |
        +---------+             +---------+             +---------+
           ^  |                    ^  |                     |
           |  | w=0                |  | w=0                 | w=0
           |  +--------------------+  +---------------------+

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Problem is Solved in Verilog

### üëá State Encoding

```verilog
parameter [1:0] A = 2'b00, B = 2'b01, C = 2'b10;
```

Each state is encoded using **2 bits**.

### ‚è± Clocked Transition Logic

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
```

Triggered on:

- **Positive edge** of the clock (normal operation)
- **Positive edge** of reset (to initialize the FSM)

### üîÅ Transition Logic

```verilog
casex(y)
    A: if (w == 1) Y = B; else Y = A;
    B: if (w == 1) Y = C; else Y = A;
    C: if (w == 1) Y = C; else Y = A;
```

Defines how the FSM moves between states based on input `w`.

### üßæ Output Logic

```verilog
assign z = (y == C);
```

Since it's a **Moore machine**, output depends **only on the current state `y`**.

## üìã Step-by-Step Example

**Input Sequence**:  
`w = 0  1  1  0  1  1  0`

| Cycle | Input `w` | State `y` | Output `z` |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 1     | 0         | A         | 0          |
| 2     | 1         | B         | 0          |
| 3     | 1         | C         | 1 ‚úÖ       |
| 4     | 0         | A         | 0          |
| 5     | 1         | B         | 0          |
| 6     | 1         | C         | 1 ‚úÖ       |
| 7     | 0         | A         | 0          |

| Input          | `w`                                          |
| Output         | `z = 1` after two `1`s in a row              |
| States         | A, B, C                                      |
| Output logic   | Based **only on state** (Moore property)     |
| Implementation | Uses `always` and `casex` blocks             |
| Reset behavior | Synchronous reset to state A                 |
| Use case       | Pattern detection, controller logic, filters |
