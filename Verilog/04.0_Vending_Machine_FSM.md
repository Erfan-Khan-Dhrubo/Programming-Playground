# 🥤 Vending Machine FSM

---

## 🎯 Objective

Design and simulate a sequential digital circuit (FSM) for a **vending machine** that:

- Accepts money
- Dispenses product when enough money is received
- Returns appropriate change
- Is implemented using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**

---

## 🧠 What Is a Vending Machine?

A vending machine is a real-world system that:

- **Tracks inserted money**
- **Decides when to dispense a product**
- **Returns change as needed**
- Accepts denominations: **0, 5, 10, 20 Taka**

---

## ⚙️ FSM Components

- **Inputs**: Inserted money (0, 5, 10, 20)
- **Outputs**:
  - Product dispensing signal (Yes/No)
  - Change amount (0, 5, 10, 15)
- **States**: Represent current balance
- **Transitions**: Based on additional money inserted

## 🧪 FSM Design Cases

### 🔹 Case 1: 10 Taka Product

#### 📌 States:

- S0: 0 Taka
- S1: 5 Taka

#### 📈 State Table:

| Input | From | To  | Output (Product, Change) |
| ----- | ---- | --- | ------------------------ |
| 0     | S0   | S0  | No product, 0 Taka       |
| 5     | S0   | S1  | No product, 0 Taka       |
| 10    | S0   | S0  | Product, 0 Taka          |
| 20    | S0   | S0  | Product, 10 Taka         |
| 5     | S1   | S0  | Product, 0 Taka          |
| 10    | S1   | S0  | Product, 5 Taka          |
| 20    | S1   | S0  | Product, 15 Taka         |

#### 💡 Summary:

- Product dispensed if total >= 10
- Returns change appropriately
- Resets to S0 after transaction

---

### 🔹 Case 2: 15 Taka Product

#### 📌 States:

- S0: 0 Taka
- S1: 5 Taka
- S2: 10 Taka

#### 📈 State Table:

| Input | From | To  | Output (Product, Change) |
| ----- | ---- | --- | ------------------------ |
| 5     | S0   | S1  | No product, 0 Taka       |
| 5     | S1   | S2  | No product, 0 Taka       |
| 5     | S2   | S0  | Product, 0 Taka          |
| 10    | S0   | S2  | No product, 0 Taka       |
| 10    | S2   | S0  | Product, 5 Taka          |
| 20    | S0   | S0  | Product, 5 Taka          |
| 20    | S2   | S0  | Product, 15 Taka         |

#### 💡 Summary:

- Product requires 15 Taka
- FSM transitions across 3 states
- Returns change if more than 15 is inserted

---

### 🔹 Case 3: 20 Taka Product

- More complex FSM (not fully detailed in lab)
- Likely requires 4+ states: S0, S1 (5), S2 (10), S3 (15)
- Similar logic: track balance, dispense product at 20, return any extra as change

---

## 🧰 Implementation Elements

### 📜 State Encoding

```verilog
parameter S0 = 2'b00, S1 = 2'b01, S2 = 2'b10;
```

### 🔁 Always Block for State Transition

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
  if (reset)
    state <= S0;
  else
    state <= next_state;
end
```

### 🔄 Next-State Logic (Example)

```verilog
case (state)
  S0: if (money == 5) next_state = S1;
      else if (money == 10) next_state = S0; // dispense
  S1: if (money == 5) next_state = S0; // dispense
endcase
```

### 🧾 Output Logic

```verilog
assign product = (state == S1 && money == 5);
assign change = (state == S1 && money == 10) ? 5 : 0;
```

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will learn to:

- **Model real-world systems as FSMs**
- **Design state diagrams and tables**
- **Write FSM logic in Verilog**
- **Implement Mealy-style FSMs** (output depends on state + input)
